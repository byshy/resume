# resume

This project is created to serve as backend API for a Flutter based frontend project to showcase various projects of software developers, UI/UX designers, etc.

Users will be able to:
* create accounts
* upload/delete/update new projects
* add various links to their projects (optional)
* add a picture their projects (optional and not yet implemented)

> This is my first take on Django.
